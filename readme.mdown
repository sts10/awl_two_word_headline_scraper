# Awl Two-Word Headline Scraper

Uses Node.js to scrape [The Awl](http://www.theawl.com/) for headlines that are two words. The `site` is [live here](http://samschlinkert.com/awl-two-headlines/). 

Note: `app.js` tries to skip posts about songs by not including headlines where the second word is in quotes.

This is my first Node.js project! Woohoo! Here's [blog post about it](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2016/05/07/website-scraped/).
